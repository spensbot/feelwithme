      <h2>Spotify Information</h2>
      <p>
        The majority of Feel With Me's features require users to login with
        Spotify. By logging into Spotify, we will use Spotify's API to retrieve
        certain account information, such as: account ID, profile URL, profile
        picture, display name, and more. We will also retrieve your top 50 songs
        and artists (from your Spotify history) from Spotify's API. Upon account
        creation, your Spotify Profile URL, Profile Picture, Display Name, and
        your top 50 songs and artists will be publicly visible to any other Feel
        With Me user.
      </p>
      <h2>Profile Information</h2>
      <p>
        Once you create an account by logging in with Spotify, you will be able
        to modify various aspects of your profile, such as: profile picture,
        display name, and bio. This information will be publicly visible to any other
        Feel With Me user. Feel With Me is not responsible for the content you choose to put in your profile. Additionally, some content may not comply with our Terms of Service. See the Terms of Service for more.
